# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Created a summary DataFrame of the provided ride-sharing data by city type and, using Pandas and Matplotlib, created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type in order to summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

The total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type are show below:

Urban locations make up the highest percentage of the data, followed by suburban and then rural as the lowest. One example of these differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types is shown in the below graph of total fares by city type:

## Summary
1. Market more in rural areas, which have the lowest number of rides but the highest average fair.
2. Hire more drivers in rural and suburban areas and less in urban areas to match demand.
3. Despite having the highest number of rides, Urban areas have the lowest average fair (most likely due to distance). Consider adding a surcharge for shorter rides.
